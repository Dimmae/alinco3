Alinco3
-------

This is a "fork" of the Alinco3 public repository available here: https://alinco3.codeplex.com/.
It seems this is abandonware, as the original project hasn't been updated since 2010.

What Is This?
-------------

Alinco3 is a plugin for the 'Decal' program for use with Asheron's Call.

The plugin assists with item detection, looting, salvaging, and many other functions.  It also
has a plugin "AlincoBuffs" that assists with buffing your toon.  (Beneficial spellcasting at
regular intervals.)

Why'd you fork it?
------------------

The code is open-source, and I don't like working in CodePlex.  My goals with this are purely
personal.  I'll fix issues I've encountered, but I do welcome bug reports.  I don't have an
official place I'm hosting any installers yet, but I may in the future.
